        "abstract": "The aim of this research was to understand what affects people\u2019s privacy preferences in smartphone apps. We ran a fourweek study in the wild with 34 participants. Participants were asked to answer questions, which were used to gather information about their personal context and to measure their privacy preferences, by varying app name and the purpose of data collection. Our results show that participants shared the most when no information about data access or purpose was given, and shared the least when both of these details were specified. When just one of either purpose or the requesting app was shown, participants shared less when just the purpose was specified than when just the app name was given. We found that the predominant factor affecting users\u2019 choices was the purpose for data access. In our study the purpose varied from being not specified, to vague, to being very specific. Participants were more willing to disclose data when no purpose was specified. When a vague purpose was shown, participants became more privacy-aware and were less willing to disclose their information. When specific purposes were shown, participants were more willing to disclose, provided the purpose for requesting the information appeared to be beneficial to them, while participants shared the least when the purpose for data access was solely beneficial to developers.",

        "abstract": "Continuous authentication has been proposed as a possible approach for passive and seamless user authentication, using sensor data comprising biometric, behavioral, and contextoriented characteristics. Since these are personal data being transmitted and are outside the control of the user, this approach causes privacy issues. Continuous authentication has security challenges concerning poor matching rates and susceptibility of replay attacks. The security issues are mainly poor matching rates and the problems of replay attacks. In this survey, we present an overview of continuous authentication and comprehensively discusses its different modes, and issues that these modes have related to security, privacy, and usability. A comparison of privacy-preserving approaches dealing with the privacy issues is provided, and lastly recommendations for secure, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly continuous authentication.",

        "abstract": "In order to direct and build an effective, secure mobile ecosystem, we must first understand user attitudes toward security and privacy for smartphones and how they may differ from attitudes toward more traditional computing systems. What are users\u2019 comfort levels in performing different tasks? How do users select applications? What are their overall perceptions of the platform? This understanding will help inform the design of more secure smartphones that will enable users to safely and confidently benefit from the potential and convenience offered by mobile platforms. To gain insight into user perceptions of smartphone security and installation habits, we conduct a user study involving 60 smartphone users. First, we interview users about their willingness to perform certain tasks on their smartphones to test the hypothesis that people currently avoid using their phones due to privacy and security concerns. Second, we analyze why and how they select applications, which provides information about how users decide to trust applications. Based on our findings, we present recommendations and opportunities for services that will help users safely and confidently use mobile applications and platforms.",

        "abstract": "Android\u2019s permission system is intended to inform users about the risks of installing applications. When a user installs an application, he or she has the opportunity to review the application\u2019s permission requests and cancel the installation if the permissions are excessive or objectionable. We examine whether the Android permission system is effective at warning users. In particular, we evaluate whether Android users pay attention to, understand, and act on permission information during installation. We performed two usability studies: an Internet survey of 308 Android users, and a laboratory study wherein we interviewed and observed 25 Android users. Study participants displayed low attention and comprehension rates: both the Internet survey and laboratory study found that 17% of participants paid attention to permissions during installation, and only 3% of Internet survey respondents could correctly answer all three permission comprehension questions. This indicates that current Android permission warnings do not help most users make correct security decisions. However, a notable minority of users demonstrated both awareness of permission warnings and reasonable rates of comprehension. We present recommendations for improving user attention and comprehension, as well as identify open challenges.",

        "abstract": "Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people\u2019s perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one\u2019s location information, but people would likely view the map\u2019s use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users\u2019 expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people\u2019s expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.",

        "abstract": "As they compete for developers, mobile app ecosystems have been exposing a growing number of APIs through their software development kits. Many of these APIs involve accessing sensitive functionality and/or user data and require approval by users. Android for instance allows developers to select from over 130 possible permissions. Expecting users to review and possibly adjust settings related to these permissions has proven unrealistic. In this paper, we report on the results of a study analyzing people\u2019s privacy preferences when it comes to granting permissions to different mobile apps. Our results suggest that, while people\u2019s mobile app privacy preferences are diverse, a relatively small number of profiles can be identified that offer the promise of significantly simplifying the decisions mobile users have to make. Specifically, our results are based on the analysis of settings of 4.8 million smartphone users of a mobile security and privacy platform. The platform relies on a rooted version of Android where users are allowed to choose between \u201cgranting\u201d, \u201cdenying\u201d or \u201crequesting to be dynamically prompted\u201d when it comes to granting 12 different Android permissions to mobile apps they have downloaded.",

While previous work has shown that privacy nudges are effective in encouraging users to adjust their privacy settings, current privacy nudges are considered to be annoying. Previous research found that modalities influence the effectiveness of responses to system messages. Hence, with the aim of improving the usability of privacy nudges, we conducted both a lab and a 3- day field study to empirically investigate how users perceive receiving privacy nudges using different modalities (combinations of visual, vibration, audio and speech). Our results suggest that app designers should implement privacy nudges which cede the decision of their delivery time to the users themselves. Most importantly, our findings reveal that to minimize annoyance, intrusiveness and interruption, while still being read, low priority notifications should not be delivered using salient modalities (i.e., audio or speech).",
